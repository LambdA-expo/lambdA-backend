# Backend for MVP

## Branching Rules 
- for creating new feature :  `feature/<feature_name>`
- bug fixing : `bugFix/<bug_name>`
- hotfix : `hotfix/<hotfix_name>`

Terms : 
    - Franchisor -> who wants to sell his business to an individual
    - Franchise or Buyer -> who want to buy rights to open a franchisor's business

MVP Features :
    
    a. feature/login-signup : login and signup for both Franchisor and Buyers
    b. feature/otp-verifcation : otp verification common for both login and signup 
    c. feature/franchise-connection : connection/interested request to franchisor
    d. feature/enable-chat-app: enabling chat application

**Buyer/Franchise Side:**
    1. Buyer browses Franchisors from the **Franchisor Table**.
    2. On viewing a specific Franchisor, they see the requirements and questions.
    3. The buyer submits their interest via the **Interest Table**, providing:
       - Answers to any questions (stored in the `responses` field)
    4. After submission, their interest is set to "Pending" and they wait for approval.

**Franchisor Owner Side:**
    1. Franchisor owner lists a Franchisor in the **Franchisor Table** with requirements and custom questions.
    2. They can view an approval dashboard, showing all **interested buyers** from the **Interest Table**.
    3. Once they approve a buyer's request, the `status` in the **Interest Table** changes to "Approved."
   
**Chat Application**
    1. If Franchisor owner approves buyer request then enable chat application for both buyer and Franchisor.


# DATABASE SCHEMA
